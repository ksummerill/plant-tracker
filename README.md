# Plant Tracker

This app is for the garden enthusiast! Add plants to your account to capture the name, amount of sun needed and required watering to make sure your garden is healthy and thriving. As your plants grow, you can edit what's needed to care for them. When you harvest or lose a plant, you can delete it from your account.
